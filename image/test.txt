In order to do so, we characterized all SN publications according to their associated research topics by exploiting the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a large-scale automatically generated taxonomy of research areas #AUTHOR_TAG	 In this paper, we present Smart Book Recommender (SBR)2, an ontology-based recommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with Springer Nature (SN) for supporting their Computer Science editorial team in selecting products to	 Furthermore, SBR allows users to investigate why a certain publication was suggested by means of an interactive graph view that compares the topics of the suggested publication with those characterizing the input conference. The rest of the paper is	0
We assess the similarity of two semantic vectors using the cosine similarity #AUTHOR_TAG, since this measure relies on the orientation but not the magnitude of the topic weights in the vector space, allowing us to compare editorial products associated with a different number of chapters			0
Following the process of reflection presented by #AUTHOR_TAG (1996), in the new version the first word of 4 questions were added as a visual prompt			0
The lived experiences were extracted from a website called everydaysexism.com where people shared their experiences on everyday sexism ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2017)			0
A study compared PLEX Cards, which contain a definition and an informative illustration; and DIXIT Cards, which represent abstract illustrations, and found similar results in terms of numbers of ideas generated ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014)			1
Most of the participatory models to design educational games are founded on educational theories and game design (see for example: Amory, 2007; #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2015)			4
Some more recent models, though, have also included domain experts to define the learning content of the educational game (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2017)			4
Contrary to Anderson, #AUTHOR_TAG  used citations from Google Scholar (GS) and correlated these against the results from the New Zealand PRFS in 2008			0
The rankings are of critical importance to the institutes as approximately ��_��__��_��__��_1.6 billion in QR funding from central government is distributed annually entirely on the basis of the REF results #AUTHOR_TAG.			0
An ad hoc study by #AUTHOR_TAG also found a moderate to strong correlation between departmental research funding based on the results of the UK's Research Assessment and Evaluation (RAE) exercise conducted in 2008, and departmental h-index			1
Yet, peer review has been shown by [16], #AUTHOR_TAG and [18] amongst others to exhibit many forms of bias including institutional bias, gender / age related bias and bias against interdisciplinary research			0
In an examination of one of the most critical forms of bias, that of publication bias, #AUTHOR_TAG [19] noted that reviewers were much more likely to recommend papers demonstrating positive results over those that demonstrated null or negative results.			1
It is not clear from our analysis that such work is being done yet in the NACP #AUTHOR_TAG, 2011			0
For example, one study explored the introduction of scientists who were previously unacquainted and from different research backgrounds using brief meetings during a conference ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014)			3
Network analysis is a research approach that prioritizes relationships between social units as opposed to focusing on attributes of the individual units themselves (#AUTHOR_TAG and Faust, 1994)			5
"RankJournals Articles % of total institutionally co-authored if it has more than one author address, suggesting that the authors come from various institutions, departments, or other kinds of units"" (#AUTHOR_TAG and Persson, 1996)"			5
These investigations may also include the specific role humans play in the carbon cycle, such as the impact of human-generated emissions or the consequences of climate change to agriculture and food systems (Berthelot et al., 2002;Bradbear and Friel, 2013;#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2014;Shindell et al., 2012)			0
Scientists frequently study these biogeochemical cycles in the context of subsystems such as the terrestrial biosphere (land-based living systems), oceanic systems (both organic and inorganic forms of carbon), and the atmosphere ( #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2000)			0
Acute toxicity and adverse effects were reported using the NCI common toxicity criteria v2.0 and RTOG/EORTC recommendations for classifying late toxic effects of radiotherapy [#AUTHOR_TAG,25]			5
Hematologic toxicity of gemcitabine-based CRT is directly related to radiotherapy volume and, therefore, volumes were strictly limited #AUTHOR_TAG [32][33]			5
